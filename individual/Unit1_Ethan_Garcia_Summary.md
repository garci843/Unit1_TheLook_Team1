**1) What I Found**
   
I began this analysis by building three core business KPIs to understand overall performance trends: monthly revenue growth, average order value (AOV), and repeat purchase rate (RPR). These metrics helped establish context around both customer behavior and revenue sustainability. Revenue has been increasing steadily over time, although growth varies month to month. AOV remained relatively stable with slight seasonal fluctuation, while RPR revealed that only a small share of customers return to buy again within a short period, suggesting room for retention-focused strategies.
From there, I selected a specific segment to investigate more deeply: Fashion Hoodies & Sweatshirts purchased by male customers. I analyzed this segment by region, acquisition channel, device/browser, and discount band to identify key revenue drivers. Chrome users generated the largest portion of revenue, and organic traffic appeared to be the dominant acquisition source. When examining discount behavior, most revenue came from purchases with minimal discounts (0â€“5%), which suggests that shoppers in this segment are not heavily price-sensitive. A Sankey visualization helped uncover the flow of revenue from traffic source to device behavior to discount use and region-level demand, making it clear that a few browsing behaviors and acquisition sources generate most of the value.

**2) What Changed After Validation**
   
During validation, I tested whether the revenue trends I observed were reliable or being influenced by hidden biases. First, I examined revenue sensitivity to order status, confirming that including canceled or returned orders could distort analysis. As a result, I restricted the investigation to completed orders only. Next, I validated AOV across devices by comparing mean vs. median sale price. This ensured that a small number of high purchase values did not skew averages and mislead interpretation. The median AOV was close to the mean, which confirmed that the metric was not overly impacted by outliers.
I also validated segment assumptions by checking the influence of discounts. Even though the majority of revenue appeared to come from low-discount purchases, I confirmed via discount-band analysis that a small number of regions showed increased sales only when higher discounts were offered. Without testing this, I might have concluded incorrectly that revenue growth was entirely organic. These validation checks helped prevent misleading conclusions and strengthened confidence that my findings reflect underlying customer behavior rather than anomalies in the data.

**3) What I Propose**
   
Based on these findings, I recommend focusing on high-intent organic traffic and Chrome users within this segment, as these customers already show strong conversion behavior with minimal discount incentives. Rather than increasing promotional spending, I propose testing lightweight retention offers such as free shipping thresholds or personalized product recommendations to increase repeat purchase rate without harming margins. There is also an opportunity to expand in mid-performing states that show activity but lack targeted campaigns. Running small, region-specific experiments could reveal untapped growth areas.
From a technical and process standpoint, I recommend adopting consistent validation steps for future analysis, including order status filtering, median-based AOV checks, and discount elasticity tests. These techniques reduce noise and improve metric reliability. For the next phase, I would integrate marketing channel cost data to measure ROI by segment and move toward profitability-based decision-making rather than focusing on revenue alone. Success will be measured by incremental gains in repeat purchase rate and stable AOV without increasing discount dependency.
