My Tasks:
My tasks for this project were to create a model to predict the depth of the Earthquake using the batch dataset we obtained from Kaggle. I downloaded the dataset from kaggle using Google Colab and transfered the dataset into a BigQuery table and created a machine learning model in SQL to try and predict the depth of the earthquake. My next task was to develop the KPI Dashboard in Looker Studio. I was able to create 3 visualizations including a time series plot showing the depth of the earthquakes overtime to see if there was a pattern there.


Lessons Learned:
Some lessons that I learned were to reflect back to previous labs if I had gotten stuck at any point during this project. This ensured I was constantly making progress and not wasting time just sitting there and trying to figure it out myself. Also asking other group memebers for their inputs as well helped. We had 3 of us working with the batch data so we all helped each other along the way if anyone needed anything. I also learned a great deal about GCP and BigQuery and streaming live data as well. This is super valuable knowledge to have that I am greatful I got to experience.
